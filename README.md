# üéà For Beginner Developers

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Welcome aboard!

If you feel daunted by all of this, no worries! This guide will help you get an understanding of how this flow works.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Take/create a ticket from Clickup

Get started by <a href="https://app.clickup.com/9003010024/v/dc/8c9y1z8-5191/8c9y1z8-19471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connecting your Github account to Clickup</a> if you haven't done so yet.

Head over to the Clickup Kanban board and see if there is anything that you can tackle. Have an idea that's not on the board? Create it yourself and start working on it! Follow the instructions on Clickup on how to create your own branch from the <a href="https://app.clickup.com/9003010024/v/b/6-901102647742-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanban board</a>.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement and program!

Go ham! Type and program to your heart's content! This part might take the longest and that's okay! Being slow is all part of the learning progress and it gets better the more you code. Don't forget to test everything before moving onto the next step!

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Push Request

Once everything is looking good, it's time to merge it to the `main` branch. It's like writing a book. You just finished writing an amazing story and it's time to have it sent to a publisher. A push request (PR) says "Hey I'm ready to publish my contributions!" Just like how publishing a book works, after putting in a PR, your code will be reviewed by a team member to verify if everything looks good or not. Some things may be pointed out for some revision, but eventually, your PR will be approved and then you can merge into the `main` branch!

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat!

How did that feel? Exciting? Exhilarating? There's always more work to be done to this bot, so how about starting again from step 1?
